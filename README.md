# What I learned 🪄

I learned a lot about JavaScript while working on my second project with it, and it was worth the time. <br>
Despite encountering difficulties in understanding how the submit button works, I decided to take on the challenge by reading several articles and watching multiple videos on YouTube. My goal was to learn how to link the questions and store the scores for the result site. <br>
Although it required a considerable amount of time and effort, I am proud of myself for not giving up and persevering until I achieved the desired outcome. <br>
I have only solved one of the many mysteries of JavaScript, but it feels like a significant accomplishment. 🎉
